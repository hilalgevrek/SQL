# SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating 
relational databases. It is a standard language used for storing, manipulating, and retrieving 
data in a database management system (DBMS).

SQL is used to perform various tasks, such as creating and modifying database structures, inserting, 
updating, and deleting data in a database, and retrieving data from a database. It is a declarative 
language, which means that the user specifies what they want the database to do, rather than how to 
do it.

SQL is used by many relational database management systems such as Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, 
PostgreSQL, and SQLite, among others. It is a widely used language and is popular among developers, data 
analysts, and data scientists due to its flexibility and scalability.

SQL is divided into several categories, such as Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation 
Language (DML), Data Control Language (DCL), and Transaction Control Language (TCL). The most commonly 
used SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.
